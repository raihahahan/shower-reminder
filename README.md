# ShowerReminderBot 🚿💧

A fun and effective way to remind people to maintain good hygiene by gamifying their shower routine!

---

## 🛠️ Overview

**ShowerTimeBot** is a Telegram bot that helps users keep track of their showering habits using an innovative system involving QR codes, a photo-based ML model, and a reminder feature.

Users scan a QR code in their bathroom and interact with the bot to start and stop their shower timer. An ML model verifies the presence of a showerhead, ensuring the timer is only activated during actual showers.

## ✨ Features

- **QR Code Integration**:  
  Users scan a QR code pasted in their bathroom to interact with the bot.

- **ML Verification**:  
  The bot ensures a valid shower session by analyzing the picture for a showerhead.

- **Shower Timer**:  
  A timer starts when the shower begins and stops when the user scans the QR code again. The bot verifies if the session lasted at least 10 minutes.

- **Daily Reminders**:  
  A daily reminder system on Telegram to prompt users to maintain good hygiene.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Setup**:

   - Paste a unique QR code in your bathroom.
   - Link it to the Telegram bot during setup.

2. **Starting a Shower**:

   - Scan the QR code and send a picture to the bot.
   - The bot sends the image to an ML model to check for a showerhead.
   - If the image is verified, the timer starts.

3. **Ending a Shower**:

   - Scan the QR code again after your shower.
   - The bot checks the duration and sends a summary of your shower time.
   - A minimum shower duration of 10 minutes is encouraged.

4. **Daily Reminders**:
   - The bot sends you a friendly reminder on Telegram to shower if you haven’t already.
